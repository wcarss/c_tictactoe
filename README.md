# Meh-quality C TicTacToe

## Build Instructions

Run 'make' to run. Requires the gcc C compiler and make to be present in your environment's path.

## Run Instructions

Run 'tictactoe' or 'tictactoe.exe' (depending on platform) to start the game. Enter co-ordinates at
the direction of the program until the game has concluded with a victor or in a tie. To cleanly exit
early, the player may enter 'exit', 'quit', or 'q' at any input prompt.
